## Project Overview 
This is a report on HR Employee Distribution using **Microsoft SQL** for the data cleaning and **Power BI** for visualization. 
I stumbled upon the dataset (can't seem to reminder how). The dataset contains over 65,000 rows and 13 columns of employment details of an organization from 2000 to 2020.

### Questions Asked
1. What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
2. What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
3. What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
4. How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
5. What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
6. How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
7. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
8. Which department has the highest turnover rate?
9. What is the distribution of employees across locations by city and state?
10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?

### Tools Used
**Microsoft SQL** - For Data Cleaning and Analysis. 

**Power BI** - For Visualization

### Findings
1. While the male population is slightly more than the female population, the non-conforming is a tiny fraction of the total staff population.
2. The White race has the highest population. The Black/African American and Asian races are fairly represented, while the Native Haiwaian is the least represented race in the organization.  
3. I adopted a range of 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64 for the age distribution. The age range of 35-44 has the highest number and 18-24 has the least number. 
4. Approximately 14,000 employees work at the headquarter as against 5,000 who work remotely.
5. The average length of employment for employees who have been terminated is 8 years.
6. Apart from the Research and Development Department where the number of male and female employees are even, the number of male in all other departments is higher than the female, albeit almost evenly distributed.
7. Research Analyst II is the most job title, while Assistant Professor, VP of Training and Development, Associate Professor, Office Assistant IV and Marketing Manager each have one employee.
8. The Auditing department has the highest turnover rate.
9. There are more employees in Ohio than any other state. Kentucky has the least.
10. There is a steady growth in the company's employee net change over the time.
11. The average tenure for the company is 7 years.
